## 📖 About Me

I'm an AI engineer with a passion for **transforming healthcare through technology**. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE (AI & ML) at PES University, I've dedicated my academic journey to developing AI solutions that make real-world medical impact—from detecting lung diseases and brain tumors to identifying skin conditions like monkeypox and measles.

Beyond technical expertise, I'm deeply interested in **management and entrepreneurship**. As Head of **AURA** (AIML Unleashed Research And Advancement), I've led workshops, hackathons, and contests, developing skills in team coordination, resource planning, and end-to-end project execution. I believe that combining technical innovation with strong leadership is key to building impactful healthcare solutions.

To complement my technical skills, I'm pursuing **Finance studies at the London School of Economics** this summer. I believe in building not just innovative technologies, but scalable ventures that bring them to market and create lasting impact—whether in healthcare, fintech, or emerging tech sectors.
