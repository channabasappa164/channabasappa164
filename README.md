## 📖 About Me

I'm an **AI engineer** and **Full Stack Developer** with a passion for **transforming healthcare through technology**. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE (AI & ML), I've dedicated my academic journey to developing AI solutions that make real-world medical impact—from detecting lung diseases to identifying skin conditions.

I don't just build models; I build applications. With strong proficiency in **React, Node.js, and SQL**, I develop full-stack platforms that bring AI solutions to life for end-users. My work on a comprehensive **Hospital Management System** demonstrates my ability to handle end-to-end development, from database design to user interface.
